## 🆘 "But I'm not technical!"

**That's fine!** Here's the truth:

**With Webflow:**
You still need to learn:
- How Webflow designer works
- Webflow CMS structure
- How to connect Whalesync
- Webflow interactions
- Responsive design in Webflow

**With Cursor AI:**
You need to learn:
- How to copy/paste prompts into Cursor
- How to run terminal commands
- Basic Notion database setup
- How to click "Deploy" on Vercel

**Honestly, both have a learning curve.**

The difference: 
- Webflow knowledge = only useful in Webflow
- Code knowledge = useful everywhere, better for career
